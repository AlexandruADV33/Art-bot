# Rufus

Rufus is a dicord bot with the intention of replacing MEE6. This uses javascript as its programming language and has no SQL database to change the prefix.

The extensive guide to building a Javascript bot can be found [here](discordjs.guide).

This is no way affliated to the company Rufus

# Features
• Automeme feature - Post memes every one hour (time can be changed) from an array of subreddits at random. The API link in the array can be edited to add more subreddits.


• Manuals - A lot of my friends were new to the enviornment of discord. To easen them up they only had to remember one prefix only and a the bot name they wanted to know about.

• Moderation - Ban, kick, warn, prune messages, mute and unmute all and muting and unmuting a user (same goes for deafening) features are included with appropriate permissions.

• AutoModeration - Remove a list of bad words and dangerous links (nsfw included) along with captcha for new members(bots are ignored) and keep your server clean.

• Games - Currently 8ball and TicTacToe are included.

• QR code generator for links.

• API integrations - Currently ReviewMeta API, Reddit meme API, Urban Dictionary API, Number API, CatFact API, Dogpile API, NASA API and Tenor API are being used.

• Heroku integration - A free cloud hosting for small bots for few guilds (servers). The bot remains online 24/7.
